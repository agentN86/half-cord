# Half-Cord

Half-Cord is a simple implementation of adding Discord's rich presence to Half-Life. This project is currently **in progress,** so expect bugs and more. This project will be open source once its released. This project will firsted be worked on in <img src="windows.png" width="20"/> Windows, so Mac and Linux will come next once the Windows version is done.

# Example
Here is an example of the rich presence in action.

# Credits
This project uses the Discord rich presence API. You can get it yourself at [https://github.com/discord/discord-rpc/releases](https://github.com/discord/discord-rpc/releases). I would also like to thank the [VALVE software wiki](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Implementing_Discord_RPC), for a starting hand.
